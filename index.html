            <p>A grid is simply a collection of horizontal and vertical lines
              creating a pattern against which we can line up our design
              elements. They help us to create designs where elements don’t jump
              around or change width as we move from page to page, providing
              greater consistency on our websites.</p>
            <p>A grid will typically have <strong>columns</strong>,
              <strong>rows</strong>, and then gaps between each row and column —
              commonly referred to as <strong>gutters</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="defining_a_grid">
          <header>Defining a grid</header>
            <p>To define a grid we use the <code>grid</code> value of the
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display">
              display</a> property. As with Flexbox, this switches on Grid
              Layout, and all of the direct children of the container become
              grid items. Add this to the CSS inside your file: </p>
            <code>
              .container {
                  display: grid;
              }
            </code>
            <p>Unlike flexbox, the items will not immediately look any
              different. Declaring <code>display: grid</code> gives you a one
              column grid, so your items will continue to display one below the
              other as they do in normal flow.</p>
            <p>
              To see something that looks more grid-like, we will need to add
              some columns to the grid. Let's add three 200-pixel columns here.
              You can use any length unit, or percentages to create these column
              tracks.
            </p>
            <code>
              .container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
              }
            </code>
            <p>
              Add the 2nd declaration to your CSS rule, then reload the page,
              and you should see that the items have rearranged themselves one
              into each cell of the created grid.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="flexible_grids_with_the_fr_unit">
          <header>Flexible grids with the fr unit</header>
            <p>In addition to creating grids using lengths and percentages, we
              can use the fr unit to flexibly size grid rows and columns. This
              unit represents one fraction of the available space in the grid
              container.</p>
            <p>The fr unit distributes space in proportion, therefore you can
              give different positive values to your tracks, for example if you
              change the definition like so:</p>
            <code>
              .container {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
              }
            </code>
            <p>The first track now gets 2fr of the available space and the other
               two tracks get 1fr, making the first track larger. You can mix fr
               units and fixed length tracks — in such a case the space needed
               for the fixed tracks is taken away before the space is
               distributed to the other tracks.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="gaps_between_tracks">
          <header>Gaps between tracks</header>
            <p>To create gaps between tracks we use the properties
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/column-gap">
              <code>grid-column-gap</code></a> for gaps between columns,
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/row-gap">
              <code>grid-row-gap</code></a> for gaps between rows, and
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap">
              <code>grid-gap</code></a> to set both at once.</p>
            <code>
              .container {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
                  grid-gap: 20px;
              }
            </code>
            <p>These gaps can be any length unit or a percentage, but not an fr
              unit.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="repeating_track_listings">
          <header>Repeating track listings</header>
            <p>You can repeat all, or a section of, your track listing using
              repeat notation. Change your track listing to the following:</p>
            <code>
              .container {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                  grid-gap: 20px;
              }
            </code>
            <p>You will now get 3 1fr tracks just as before. The first value
              passed to the repeat function is how many times you want the
              listing to repeat, while the second value is a track listing,
              which may be one or more tracks that you want to repeat.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="the_implicit_and_explicit_grid">
          <header>The implicit and explicit grid</header>
            <p>We have only specified column tracks so far, and yet rows are
              being created to hold our content. This is an example of the
              explicit versus the implicit grid. The explicit grid is the one
              that you create using <code>grid-template-columns</code> or
              <code>grid-template-rows</code>. The implicit grid is created when
              content is placed outside of that grid — such as into our rows.
              The explicit and implicit grids are analagous to the main and
              cross flexbox axes.</p>
            <p>By default, tracks created in the implicit grid are
              <code>auto</code> sized, which in general means that they are
              large enough to fit their content. If you wish to give the tracks
              the browser creates a size you can use the
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-rows">
              <code>grid-auto-rows</code></a> and
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-columns">
              <code>grid-auto-columns</code></a> properties. If you add
              <code>grid-auto-rows</code> with a value of <code>100px</code> to
              your CSS, you will see that those created rows are now 100 pixels
              tall.</p>
            <code>
              .container {
                display: grid;
                grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                grid-auto-rows: 100px;
                grid-gap: 20px;
              }
            </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="the_minmax()_function">
          <header>The minmax() function</header>
            <p>Our 100-pixel tall tracks won’t be very useful if we add content
              into those tracks that is taller than 100 pixels, in which case it
              would cause an overflow. It might be better to have tracks that
              are <em>at least</em> 100 pixels tall and can still expand if more
              content gets into them. A fairly basic fact about the web is that
              you never really know how tall something is going to be;
              additional content or larger font sizes can cause problems with
              designs that attempt to be pixel perfect in every dimension.</p>
            <p>The <code>minmax</code> function lets us set a minimum and
              maximum size for a track, for example
              <code>minmax(100px, auto)</code>. The minimum size is 100 pixels,
              but the maximum is <code>auto</code>, which will expand to fit the
              content. Try changing <code>grid-auto-rows</code> to use a minmax
              value:</p>
            <code>
              .container {
                  display: grid;
                  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
                  grid-gap: 20px;
              }
            </code>
            <p>If you add extra content you will see that the track expands to
              allow it to fit. Note that the expansion happens right along the
              row.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="as_many_columns_as_will_fit">
          <header>As many columns as will fit</header>
            <p>We can combine some of the things we have learned about track
              listing, repeat notation and <code>minmax()</code> to create a
              useful pattern. Sometimes it is helpful to be able to ask grid to
              create as many columns as will fit into the container. We do this
              by setting the value of <code>grid-template-columns</code> using
              <code>repeat()</code> notation, but instead of passing in a
              number, pass in the keyword <code>auto-fill</code>. For the second
              parameter of the function we use <code>minmax()</code>, with a
              minimum value equal to the minimum track size that we would like
              to have, and a maximum of <code>1fr</code>.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="line-based_placement">
          <header>Line-based placement</header>
            <p>We now move on from creating a grid, to placing things on the
              grid. Our grid always has lines, these lines start at 1 and relate
              to the Writing Mode of the document. Therefore in English, column
              line 1 is on the left hand side of the grid and row line 1 at the
              top. In Arabic column line 1 would be on the righthand side, as
              Arabic is written right to left.</p>
            <p>We can place things according to these lines by specifying the
              start and end line. We do this using the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-start">
                  <code>grid-column-start</code></a></li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column-end">
                  <code>grid-column-end</code></a></li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-start">
                  <code>grid-row-start</code></a></li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row-end">
                  <code>grid-row-end</code></a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These properties can all have a line number as the value. You can
              also use the shorthand properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-column">
                <code>grid-column</code></a></li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row">
                <code>grid-row</code></a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These let you specify the start and end lines at once, separated
              by a / — a forward slash character.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="positioning_with_grid-template-areas">
          <header>Positioning with grid-template-areas</header>
            <p>An alternative way to place items on your grid is to use the
              <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas">
              <code>grid-template-areas</code></a> property and giving the
              various elements of your design a name.</p>
            <p>The rules for <code>grid-template-areas</code> are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You need to have every cell of the grid filled.</li>
              <li>To span across two cells, repeat the name.</li>
              <li>To leave a cell empty, use a <code>.</code> (period).</li>
              <li>Areas must be rectangular — you can’t have an L-shaped area
                for example.</li>
              <li>Areas can't be repeated in different locations.</li>
            </ul>
